      <p>The Epithelial Mechanics Fan Club is a vibrant, non-profit platform dedicated to sharing papers on various #EpithelialMechanics topics and mini-review <a href="https://epithelialmechanics.github.io/threads/">threads</a> by our <a href="https://epithelialmechanics.github.io/delegates/">delegates</a>. Currently, we are operating accounts on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/epimechfc.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/EpiMechFC">X</a>, fostering a global network of early-career researchers.</p>

<p>Nimesh Chahare started the Twitter account on July 23, 2023, and shortly thereafter, Julia Eckert joined him in running the club together. Since then, our community of passionate scientists has been steadily growing and has become a platform for transparent knowledge exchange, collaboration, and career support. <br /><br /></p>

<p>The Epithelial Mechanics Fan Club is currently managed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Dr. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/onenimesa.bsky.social">Nimesh Chahare</a> is a postdoctoral scientist at Columbia University in New York. His research focuses on the intersection of mechanical engineering and developmental biology, specifically exploring the morphogenesis of early embryonic brain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dr. <a href="https://julia-eckert.github.io">Julia Eckert</a> is a DFG Walter Benjamin Fellow, hosted in Alpha Yapâ€™s Lab at The University of Queensland, Australia. She is an experimental biophysicist and enthusiastic image analyst dedicated to investigating the mechanisms of morphogenesis using concepts from soft matter physics.</p>

We're your source for papers on various #EpithelialMechanics topicsðŸ“š
Check out our accounts on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/epimechfc.bsky.social) and [twitter](https://x.com/EpiMechFC).

We share one paper each working day and create mini-review threads on topics that matter to the epithelial mechanics community, gathered directly from our online community.

Nimesh Chahare started the twitter account in July 2023, and shortly thereafter, Julia Eckert joined him in running it together. For last 2 years, we provide a platform for interaction and networking for early career researchers. 

If you'd like to showcase your field, paper, or a topic that interests you, please feel free to contact us.
